                <p id="support-paragraph">Jupyter will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and
                released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license. If you have found Jupyter to be useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps!
                All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of Project Jupyter's open source software, documentation
                and community.
